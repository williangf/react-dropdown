# React Dropdown Component

This is a project-based on test guidelines.

## Installation

This project was generated using _create-react-app_.
Just type the following commands to run the app:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.


## Notes

Usually, I prefer to work with _styled-components_, but I chose only to use plain CSS due to the project's size. The same goes for _typescript_.
With more time, I would do the following things within this component:

- Improve the TAB actions (in this version it works using TAB, down arrow and ENTER keys, but it's not the default behavior from the browser)
- Develop a function that verifies if the Dropdown is offscreen and automatically adjusts it.
- Properly create and configura this project as an NPM package.
- Customize for more react versions.
